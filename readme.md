## Laravel Website

This is the source of the official Laravel.com website.

The site has two main sections. The front / marketing page which is located at `resources/views/marketing.blade.php` and the documentation pages.

### Documentation

The website's documentation is loaded from the `resources/docs` directory. You will need to clone each version of the documentation into this directory. For example, `resources/docs/5.3`, etc. All of the documentation is stored on GitHub at [laravel/docs](https://githu.com/laravel/docs).
